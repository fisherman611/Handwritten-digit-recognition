This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It will test different machine learning algorithms, such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and K-nearest neighbors, to see which one performs best at recognizing the digits in the images. Here is the result of each model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBeDRDks7EBTjflbYL7hXEvMZdwMm_io/view?usp=sharing

## **Features**
* Normalize the image data to make it suitable for the algorithm.
* Training and evaluation of machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition 
* Integration with a user interface for easy interaction.
